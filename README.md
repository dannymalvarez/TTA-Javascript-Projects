# TTA-Javascript-Projects
This repo is for my Javascript projects for the TTA bootcamp

There are two main folders, the larger one, Basic JavaScript Projects, has all the JavaScript exercises from throughout the course.
The smaller, react, folder is for the React material.
The highlights of this repo are the calculator, tic tac toe, and pizza projects. These are the fully functioning builds that were fun to 
write up and gave me good hands on experience with these concepts. The React projects gave me some hands on experience with React including 
the syntax and a basic understanding of how it works

Calculator:
- This calculator is a basic 4 function (add, subtract, multiply, and divide) calculator.

Tic Tac Toe:
- This project was funny towards the end. I missed one of the lines of code to draw a line for the leftmost vertical win. And the computer playing was not quite done right on my end and I thought it was for you to play with someone else. So my wife and I played a little bit before it was brought to my attention that I ahd a typo not letting the computer play its turn. oops!

Pizza Project:
- This project is basically an online ordering menu. Click your options and see your total!
